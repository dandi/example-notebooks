# Example Sessions for Dandiset 001617

This submission provides 2 notebooks showcasing example sessions for the Dandiset 001617.

Each notebook provides an example of how to access the critical data and metadata from the 2 types of experiments in the dataset:

- `photometry_example_notebook.ipynb` showcases one example session from the 001617 dataset containing concurrent fiber photometry recordings, electrophysiology recordings, and optogenetic stimulation.
- `behavior_example_notebook.ipynb` showcases one example session from the 001617 dataset containing labeled sleep/wake behavior, concurrent electrophysiology recordings, and DeepLabCut pose estimation.
