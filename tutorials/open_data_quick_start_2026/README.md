# DANDI Quick Start Guide

Developed by request of the Open Data Registry, to briefly showcase the archive and how it helps to answer several key scientific questions. 

### Goal

To make as short of a tutorial as possible for someone to get an understanding of what DANDI is about and is capable of.

### Philosophy

Minimize verbosity and maximize clarity.

Alternate Markdown cells which prompt questions with short code snippets.

Consider how rendered views (via GitHub or DANDIHub) appear on mobile devices or when 'zoomed in' during screen sharing.

Also consider how items appear in both light mode and dark mode.

Keep distractions (such as side topics or long explanations) to a minimum.

Keep details of hyper-specific topics to a minimum while still provoking intrigue - provide links to external resources for further reading, instead.

Ensure runtime simplicity by avoiding complex/fancy elements such as interactive widgets, multi-figure visualizations, or long-running code cells. Link to other example notebooks for people to find such things.

### Design

Limit sentence length as much as possible (except for last two sections - even there, trying to be not too verbose).

Render each sentence on a separate line to decrease instances of soft-wrapping (again, except for last two sections which are meant to be solid text).

Limit code lines as much as possible (note we could use some even better helper methods in PyNWB and DANDI APIs for certain tasks like streaming).

Avoid widgets and other interactive elements (including Plotly) that may not render well in all browsers, devices, or IDEs. Stick to simple static images and plots.

Keep a fully rendered version on GitHub when done to show what it should look like when run successfully.
