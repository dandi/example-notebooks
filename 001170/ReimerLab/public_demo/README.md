# Mesoscale Two-Photon Calcium Imaging of Population Level Odor Responses from the Mouse Olfactory Bulb

This example notebook demonstrates how to access the dataset published at [DANDI:001170](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/001170/draft).

This dataset contains recordings of population level odor responses from the mouse OB with mesoscale two photon calcium 
imaging.
